						The correspondence between the seasons and the novels they adapt is approximate rather than exact: Showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss have said that they think of Game of Thrones as an adaptation of the novel series as a whole, rather than of individual books, which gives them the liberty to move scenes back and forth across books according to the requirements of the screen adaptation.

					Principal photography for the first season was scheduled to begin on July 26, 2010. The primary location was the Paint Hall Studios in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Exterior scenes in Northern Ireland were filmed at Sandy Brae in the Mourne Mountains (standing in for Vaes Dothrak), Castle Ward (Winterfell), Saintfield Estates (the Winterfell godswood), Tollymore Forest (outdoor scenes), Cairncastle (the execution site), the Magheramorne quarry (Castle Black) and at Shane's Castle (the tourney grounds). Doune Castle in Stirling, Scotland, was also used for exterior scenes at Winterfell
