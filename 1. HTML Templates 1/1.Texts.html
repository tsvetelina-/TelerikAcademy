					The series began development in <a href="#">January 2007</a>. HBO, after acquiring the rights to the novels with the intent of turning them into an international cable television series, hired David Benioff.

				The Game of Thrones's budget has been compared to that of the TV series Rome. D. B. Weiss to write and executive produce the series, which would cover one novel's worth of material per season.

				HBO hired expert language creator David J. Peterson from the Language Creation Society to develop the Dothraki language – "possessing its own unique sound, extensive vocabulary of more than 1,800 words and complex grammatical structure" – to be used in the series.
			</p>

			<p>
				The first and second drafts of the pilot script, written by Benioff and Weiss, were submitted in August 2007 and June 2008, respectively. While HBO found both drafts to their liking, a pilot was not ordered until <u>November 2008</u>, with the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike possibly delaying the process.

					<strong>
						The correspondence between the seasons and the novels they adapt is approximate rather than exact: Showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss have said that they think of Game of Thrones as an adaptation of the novel series as a whole, rather than of individual books, which gives them the liberty to move scenes back and forth across books according to the requirements of the screen adaptation.

				Principal photography for the first season was scheduled to begin on July 26, 2010. The primary location was the Paint Hall Studios in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Exterior scenes in Northern Ireland were filmed at Sandy Brae in the Mourne Mountains (standing in for Vaes Dothrak), Castle Ward (Winterfell), Saintfield Estates (the Winterfell godswood), Tollymore Forest (outdoor scenes), Cairncastle (the execution site), the Magheramorne quarry (Castle Black) and at Shane's Castle (the tourney grounds). Doune Castle in Stirling, Scotland, was also used for exterior scenes at Winterfell
