			<p>HBO hired expert language creator David J. Peterson from the Language Creation Society to develop the Dothraki language - "possessing its own unique sound, extensive vocabulary of more than 1,800 words and complex grammatical structure" - to be used in the series.</p>

			<p>The first and second drafts of the pilot script, written by Benioff and Weiss, were submitted in August 2007 and June 2008, respectively. While HBO found both drafts to their liking, a pilot was not ordered until November 2008, with the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike possibly delaying the process.</p>
